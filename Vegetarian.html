<p><ul>
<p>Using two forks, shred the chicken and give it a good stir. Or don't, it's up to you. I find that it blends the sauce together quite nicely</li></p>
<p>Eyeball your meal and decide how watery you think it looks. Does it need thickening up? It if does, start adding some of that cornflour and give it another good mix. Remember, you can always add cornflour but you can never remove it after</p>
<p>Serve with rice that can usually be cooked for three people in a rice cooker in about half an hour</p>
