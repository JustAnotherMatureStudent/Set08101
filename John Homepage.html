<h1>What brings me to Napier?</h1>
<h2>How did I get here?</h2></hgroup>

<p>My name is John and I'm a student at <a href="https://www.napier.ac.uk/">Napier University</a> studying Cyber-Security.
I decided to retrain because I was bored with my work and my journey to Napier began at <a href="https://www.west-lothian.ac.uk/">West Lothian College</a></p>

<p>If you want to read more about me and my plans, my successes and my failures, please feel free to read some of the following thoughts as I hopefully progress towards my degree</p>

<p>All education establishments referred to can be found to the right of this page.</p>
