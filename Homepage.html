<p>When I was supporting the Napier Student Fair on behalf of my employer, I got chatting to some guys who were doing a user experience degree. I asked them for some user-experience tips that might help me meet the needs of this assessment. They asked who the website was for. I said "My lecturer". </br></P>
<p>After we laughed and talked some more I gave it some more thought. Who is this website for? </br></p>

<p>The theme for this website is food. Speaking as someone who has a healthy appetite, it's not difficult for me to think about or eat food - producing a website for it however is something else entirely.</p> 

<p>That being said, the website is for me and people like me. People who lead busy lives and are short on time. </br>

For instance, I'm short on time because I'm a dad, a husband and a Cyber-Security Graduate Apprentice which means that as well as my studies I also have a full-time job.</P> 

<p>In addition to those roles, I like to go to the gym to work out the stress of the day as well as keep myself active and strong.</br></p>

<!--<img src="family.jpg" alt="family together" width="500" height="300">--> 

<p>While I don't consider myself old, I don't consider myself young either and I want to I want to remain as fit and strong as I can so I can keep up with my daughter as she grows up.</p>

<p>As parents, my wife and I want our daughter to eat healthily and we recognise the value of eating together as a family however it is a constant challenge to find the time to do each of these things.<p>

<p>The solution I've settled upon to meet this challenge is slow cooking a meal that requires as little preparation as possible and as few finishing touches as possible. the closer I can get to a one pot meal that is served straight from the slow cooker, the better!</br>
</p>

<p>As well as that though, I want a slow cooking website for people who are short on time to be simple to navigate - you shouldn't spend any more time than is necessary to get the informationy you need to make your slow cooked meal</p>

<p>If you're short on time and want to have a meal on the table for you and your kids after a busy day, this could be the website for you</p>
