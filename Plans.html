		<h1>My Plans</h1>
			<p>What inspired me to pursue a degree and a career in cyber-security was a conversation I had with a soon-to-retire lecturer at West Lothian College.<br></p>
			<p>Sadly, I've forgotten the gentleman's name however his description of "hacking club" sold it for me as well as using Kali-Linux and other tools such as Autopsy</p>
			<p>Hacking into computers as a possible career perked my interest in a way nothing had before so it is that which I'm pursuing actively although I haven't closed myself off to other career paths</p>
