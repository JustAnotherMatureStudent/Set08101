<h1>My Plans</h1>
<p>What inspired me to pursue a degree and a career in cyber-security was a conversation I had with a soon-to-retire lecturer at West Lothian College.<br></p>
<p>Sadly, I've forgotten the gentleman's name however his description of the Tuesday "hacking club" sold the course to me. 
I thought "You're going to show me how to hack into computers? You had my curiosity, now you have my attention!"</p>
<p>Some elements of the course were full on. Learning IP addressing systems, binary calculations, basic Python scripting and networking were all modules I had to work hard get to grips with.
Other modules like professionalism and ethics were drier but I enjoy writing and considering ethical and moral dilemmas so I had no problem meeting the module requirements.</p>
<p>What I really enjoyed about the HNC in Cyber-Security was in playing with Kali Linux, password cracking with John the Ripper, exploiting a vulnerability on a Windows XP machine plus the Digital Forensic work with tools like Wireshark and Autopsy.</p>
<p>Hacking into computers and to a slightly lesser degree, Digital Forensics as a possible career path perked my interest in a way nothing had before. I haven't closed myself to other career paths but I feel inspired to pursue Penetration Testing, Digital Forensics and Incident Response
as a career path</p>
